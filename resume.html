      <h3>Dear System76,</h3>
        <p>My name is Gardiner (but you already knew that). I am an ambitious, thoughtful guy looking to find a job that fits four important criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I need to be fulfilled creatively.</li>
          <li>I must meaningfully contribute.</li>
          <li>My duties must jive with my ethics and sensiblities.</li>
          <li>And most importantly... I have to feel like I belong.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other less important criteria are up for negotiation, such as: paid nap time, a standard issue utilikilt as part of the uniform, and so on.</p>
        <p>In my current position as Marketing Specialist for Perry's Home Furnishings &amp; Design, I am fulfilled in many of the above mentioned ways (sadly, we lack paid nap time). However, I feel as though System76 would be a better fit for me.</p>
        <p>I've been a Linux user for the better part of a decade. I love the community that builds it and the freedom it ensures us. I'm passionate about the mission of System76 and I believe that free and open source software has the capacity to empower makers to realize their potential.</p>
        <p>In summary, with a varied work history, independent personality, team oriented work ethic, and a high degree of dedication, I feel I'd make a great addition to any team.</p>
        <p>With sincerity,</p>
        <p>Gardiner Moody</p>
